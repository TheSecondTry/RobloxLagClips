# RobloxLagClips
A script that tries to emulate lag clipping in Roblox.

## What is lag clipping?
Lag clipping is a glitch that is used to clip through 1-stud thick walls by lagging the client.
On August 17, 2021, Roblox [patched lag clipping](https://www.speedrun.com/speedrunning/thread/ej79o), meaning this trick is now impossible to perform. This has had a negative impact on some people, mainly those in the speedrunning community. This script "brings back" lag clipping so that it is possible again.

## How do I add this to my Roblox game?
Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/luigidasonic/RobloxLagClips/releases).
Then, in Roblox Studio, go to StarterPlayer, right-click on StarterPlayerScripts, and click `Insert from File...`.
Locate the `LagClipping.rbxm` file and click `Open` to import it into your game.
